<h1><b>Code reiew</b></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Fancy pantsy javascrip on inlog fail!!!!! ‘The email has already been taken’</li>
  <li>If I register a user and don’t put in a password I can still register a user, use require in registercontroller</li>
  <li>You are able to write a letter in date
</li>
  <li>You are able to write a letter in time </li>
  <li>Nice site! Good job</li>
  <li>Delete comments 35 event controller</li>
  <li>Delete comments 17-20 create-event.blade</li>
  <li>Login.blade line 17-20 comments</li>
  <li>Register.blade line 21-24 COMMENTS!!1</li>
  <li>37 edit-event: you could store this image locally instead <img src="{{asset('/images/pizza1.png')}}"</li>
  <li>Nice structure of code</li>
  <li>Nice logic to determine which comment comes from the host in event controller </li>
  <li>Its not a big big deal but personally I believe its better to have two clear spaces between the closing bracket and the new method, it creates more air and is much easier to read while I’m doing a code review like this</li>
  <li>Sweet idea!</li>
  <li>ON LINE 84 IN EVENT CONTROLLER, YOU ONLY HAVE ONE LINE BREAK, WHILE IN THE REST OF THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR CODE YOU HAVE TWO</li>
  <li>LINE 25-27 COMMENTS! IN LOGINCONTROLLER</li>
  <li>CLEAN CODE IN LOG OUT CONTROLLER, GOOD JOB!</li>
  <li>YOU COULD USE MINIMUM LENGTH OF PASSWORD</li>
  <li>Really nice and clean application!</li>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
